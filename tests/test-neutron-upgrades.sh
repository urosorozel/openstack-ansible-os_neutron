# WARNING:
# This file is use by all OpenStack-Ansible roles for testing purposes.
# Any changes here will affect all OpenStack-Ansible role repositories
# with immediate effect.

# PURPOSE:
# This script executes test Ansible playbooks required for performing
# an upgrade test of the os_neutron role.
# Due to the way Ansible caches and handles modules, we need to run
# separate Ansible runs to ensure the "upgrade" uses the new
# "neutron_migrations_facts" module, instead of the cached version
# used when deploying the previous Neutron version.
